#Log Analysis Project

##Introduction

As a part of the Udacity Full Stack Nanodegree program, this project is meant to demonstrate knowledge of connecting to a database using Python and executing queries using SQL.

##Requirements

The database used in this project is run from a virtual machine on a the user's computer, and accessed through Python's psyopg2 package.  In order to successfully run the program you will need to

* [Set up and install VirtualBox and Vagrant](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd004/parts/8d3e23e1-9ab6-47eb-b4f3-d5dc7ef27bf0/modules/bc51d967-cb21-46f4-90ea-caf73439dc59/lessons/5475ecd6-cfdb-4418-85a2-f2583074c08d/concepts/14c72fe3-e3fe-4959-9c4b-467cf5b7c3a0)
* Have Python3 and the psyopg2 package installed
* [Download and set up the database](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd004/parts/8d3e23e1-9ab6-47eb-b4f3-d5dc7ef27bf0/modules/bc51d967-cb21-46f4-90ea-caf73439dc59/lessons/262a84d7-86dc-487d-98f9-648aa7ca5a0f/concepts/a9cf98c8-0325-4c68-b972-58d5957f1a91)

##Usage

Once the VM and database have been installed, run log_analysis.py file from your virtual machine terminal to display the results.
